        title: 'What is PCOS?',
        content: `Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal condition affecting 1 in 10 women of reproductive age. It involves an imbalance of reproductive hormones, which can cause irregular periods, excess androgen levels, and polycystic ovaries.

Key points:
• PCOS is one of the most common causes of infertility, but many with PCOS can conceive with treatment
• Symptoms vary widely between individuals
• Early diagnosis and management can reduce long-term health risks

        title: 'Diagnostic Criteria (Rotterdam)',
        content: `PCOS is typically diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria, requiring 2 of 3 features:

1. Irregular or absent periods (oligo/anovulation)
2. Clinical or biochemical signs of high androgens (excess hair, acne, blood tests)
3. Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (12+ follicles or increased ovarian volume)

Important notes:
• Diagnosis in teens requires stricter criteria due to normal adolescent changes
• Other conditions must be ruled out first (thyroid disorders, hyperprolactinemia)
• You don't need cysts to have PCOS - the name is somewhat misleading

        title: 'Types of PCOS',
        content: `While not officially classified, PCOS often presents in different phenotypes:

• Insulin-resistant PCOS: Most common, linked to weight gain and metabolic issues
• Inflammatory PCOS: Associated with chronic inflammation, fatigue, skin issues
• Adrenal PCOS: Elevated DHEA-S from adrenal glands, often with normal insulin
• Post-pill PCOS: Temporary symptoms after stopping hormonal contraception

Understanding your type can help guide management strategies. Work with your healthcare provider to identify your pattern.`

        content: `Evidence-based dietary approaches for PCOS:

• Focus on low-glycemic foods to manage insulin levels
• Include lean proteins, healthy fats, and fiber-rich vegetables
• Limit processed foods, refined sugars, and sugary drinks
• Consider anti-inflammatory foods (fatty fish, leafy greens, berries)
• Some find benefit in reducing dairy or gluten - track your response

No single "PCOS diet" works for everyone. Focus on sustainable, balanced eating.

        title: 'Exercise Guidelines',
        content: `Physical activity is highly beneficial for PCOS management:

Recommended: 150+ minutes of moderate activity per week, or 75 minutes vigorous

Benefits include:
• Improved insulin sensitivity
• Better mood and reduced anxiety
• Support for healthy weight management
• Reduced inflammation

Mix cardio (walking, swimming, cycling) with strength training. Even small amounts help - start where you are and build gradually.`
