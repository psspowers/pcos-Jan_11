        content: `Quality sleep and stress management are crucial for PCOS:

Sleep:
• Aim for 7-9 hours per night
• Poor sleep worsens insulin resistance and increases cravings
• Sleep apnea is more common with PCOS - discuss with your doctor if you snore or feel unrested

Stress Management:
• Chronic stress raises cortisol, which can worsen hormonal imbalances
• Try: meditation, deep breathing, yoga, nature walks
• Set boundaries and prioritize rest

Small improvements in sleep and stress can significantly impact symptoms.`

        title: 'Supplements (With Medical Guidance)',
        content: `Some supplements show promise for PCOS, but always consult your doctor first:

• Inositol (myo-inositol + D-chiro-inositol): May improve insulin sensitivity and ovulation
• Vitamin D: Many with PCOS are deficient; supports metabolic and reproductive health
• Omega-3 fatty acids: Anti-inflammatory benefits
• Berberine: May help with insulin resistance (not with metformin)
• NAC (N-acetyl cysteine): Antioxidant that may support fertility

Important: Supplements can interact with medications. Quality varies between brands. Work with a healthcare provider.
